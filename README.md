## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a medical doctor and independent AI/ML researcher with a deep interest in the creation of bio-inspired humanoid robots. My interdisciplinary journey bridges medicine, artificial intelligence, robotics, and computational neuroscience. I am especially passionate about leveraging AI not just for information processing, but for developing the right intuitions that drive impactful innovation.

### Key Projects

- **Leonet** ([repo](https://github.com/shilpesh619/Leonet)):  
  My flagship project, Leonet, is a bio-inspired transformer architecture featuring a dual output head. It is designed for applications where biological plausibility and multi-task learning are key, and represents my ongoing effort to blend insights from nature with cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The Leonet ecosystem also includes [leonet_robotic](https://github.com/shilpesh619/leonet_robotic), focused on the integration of AI with robotic control for humanoid agents.

### Technical Skills

- **Programming:** Python (proficient), PyTorch, NumPy, and a range of ML/DL libraries and frameworks.
- **DevOps:** CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and workflow automation for AI/robotics projects.
- **Research:** Computational neuroscience, bio-inspired architectures, and multi-modal transformer models.
- **Robotics:** Algorithmic development for humanoid robots, sensor integration, and real-world deployment.

### Philosophy

I strongly believe that in the era of advanced AI, success is less about memorizing field-specific information and more about cultivating the right intuitions and problem-solving approaches. My learning path has been shaped by hands-on experimentation, deep dives into both theory and application, and the willingness to cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.

### Hobbies

When Iâ€™m not immersed in research or development, youâ€™ll find me exploring the outdoorsâ€”trekking, hiking, long drives, and traveling to new places.
